# Rene Descartes

## Discourse on Method (1637)

By Rene Descartes

### Part I

*Some bullshit preword about developing his Method.*

### Part II

You ever notice that things made by multiple ppl/committees kinda suck, and things made by a single architect are cool? That's why God made cool shit.

I'm gonna throw away all past beliefs and derive truth by myself. Only geniuses can do this, dont try this at home. There's two types of ppl, those who pave new paths and those who follow. (*holy shit descartes is a success-win douchebag*)

Math/logic is complicated and hard, so I'm gonna only follow these hard rules,

1. Never accept anything to be true that I don't clearly know is true without doubt
2. Break problems into as many small parts as possible
3. Start with the most simple truths, and build up to more complex truths
4. Solve for the general case

### Part III

*Some bullshit about temporary rules he followed while figuring out what is true.*

### Part IV

We can't trust our senses and perceptions when looking for truth. The only thing that is obviously and inherently true is **cogito ergo sum** (I think, therefore I am). The mind is distinct from, and can exist without the body.

It could be that the stuff we perceive (sky, earth, etc.) are illusions or just ideas that exist in the mind. But we also have the idea of a perfect God, implying that we are somehow imperfect. It doesn't make sense that an imperfect mind could make up or create a perfect God. That means we are creations of a perfect God.

You know how geometry nerds can prove properties *about* triangles like their angles always add up to 180, but they can't really prove that triangles *exist*, even though you know triangles are a thing? Same way, you have an idea about the properties of a perfect God, but you can't really prove God exists. So we can be as certain that God exists as we are certain that triangles exist.

Still don't believe in God? Ok, you know how we have true thoughts and false thoughts? The fact that we can have false thoughts that are proven by nothing is because we are imperfect minds. All things we know to be clearly true are true because a perfect God made them exist. It doesn't make sense that false things are made by God, nor that true things are proven by nothing.

### Part V

*Boasting about how he figured out how the physics of the universe works, heliocentrism, etc*. Based on what I figured out, it's obvious that God only created the initial chaos and natural laws of the universe, and the world as we know it now came about from following those natural laws. God didn't do anything after that. Easier to believe things gradually came into existence, rather than being created in their final form.

Execpt people, God created humans himself. *Goes into detail about how human blood circulation works*. The human body is a perfect machine God made. Maybe we could build a machine that looked and acted like an animal, and we wouldn't know. But we couldn't build a human machine because,

1. It wouldn't know how to use language to communicate thoughts.
2. Although machines can do some actions better than us, a single machine can't do ALL actions better than we can.

Even dumbasses can do those two things. It's called *having a soul*. And a soul can't be a physical thing, so only God could have created it. Also the soul is immortal. *mic drop*

### Part VI

*A lot of bullshit about him writing this for the greater good of mankind.*
